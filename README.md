# Chest X-Ray Image Super-Resolution

## Code Overview

The provided Python script implements Chest X-Ray image super-resolution using the Enhanced Super-Resolution Convolutional Network (ESPCN). The script utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for model development, training, and evaluation. The ESPCN introduces a sub-pixel convolution layer, optimizing upscaling filters for enhanced image resolution.
